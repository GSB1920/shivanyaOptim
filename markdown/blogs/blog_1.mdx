# Build What Users Expect in 2026

Shipping a beautiful app is not enough. Users expect reliability, privacy, speed, and seamless onboarding from day one. Here’s a practical checklist of 10 features we recommend for most consumer and B2B apps.

## 1) Fast, Passwordless Sign‑In
- Support email magic links, OAuth (Google/Apple), and passkeys.
- Fall back to email+OTP for devices without biometric support.

## 2) Guided Onboarding
- 2–3 step tours that demonstrate core value in under 60 seconds.
- Save partial onboarding state, allow “skip and explore” safely.

## 3) Offline‑First Data Layer
- Cache reads and queue writes; sync transparently when online.
- Show optimistic UI with conflict resolution that favors user edits.

## 4) Realtime Updates
- Use websockets for chats, notifications, and collaborative state.
- Gracefully degrade to polling when the network is constrained.

## 5) Push Notifications That Respect Focus
- Ask for permission with context; let users pick categories/frequency.
- Link every notification to a specific screen and action.

## 6) In‑App Search
- Lightweight full‑text search for local data with server fallbacks.
- Recent searches and filters persist across sessions.

## 7) Accessible, Themed UI
- WCAG‑compliant color contrast; dark mode and large text support.
- Motion‑sensitive animations and haptic feedback with user controls.

## 8) Privacy by Design
- Clear consent for analytics and tracking; minimize PII collection.
- Local‑first preferences; easy export/delete of personal data.

## 9) Reliable Payments and Trials
- Native purchase flows (StoreKit/Play Billing) or PCI‑compliant web.
- Grace periods and clear dunning paths to reduce churn.

## 10) Observability in Production
- Crash reporting, performance traces, and feature flags.
- A/B test safely with server‑driven configs and kill‑switches.

### What This Means for Your Roadmap
Start with the smallest slice that proves value (auth → onboarding → core action). Add realtime, offline, and notifications to reinforce engagement. Build privacy and accessibility from day one—they are not optional extras anymore.
